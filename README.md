# Functional Programming in Javascript

A tutorial about RxJS and functional programming in javascript,
originally written by Jafar Husain and turned into a BDD test suite by
me.

The original tutorial can be found
[here](https://github.com/jhusain/learnrx).

## How-to

```sh
git clone https://github.com/erwanthomas/learnrx-bdd.git
cd learnrx-bdd
npm run init
npm run start
```

Then answer the exercises by editing the `exercises/local/*.md` files.
They will automatically be compiled on save to their javascript-only
version in the same folder.

Now, when you want to test your progression, simply run `npm run test`.
