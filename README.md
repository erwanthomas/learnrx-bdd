# Functional Programming in Javascript

A tutorial about RxJS and functional programming in javascript,
originally written by Jafar Husain and ReactiveX contributors, and
turned into a BDD test suite based on markdown files by me.

The source code of the original tutorial used to be
[here](https://github.com/jhusain/learnrx).
It has now moved to [here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/learnrx).

## How-to

```sh
git clone https://github.com/erwanthomas/learnrx-bdd.git
cd learnrx-bdd
npm install
npm start
```

Then answer the exercises by editing the `exercises/local/*.md` files.
They will automatically be compiled on save to their javascript-only
version in the same folder.

When you want to test your progression, simply run `npm test`.
